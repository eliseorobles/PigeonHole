## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Word Hunt + App Shell combined in Phase 1 (core value + navigation foundation delivered together)
- [Roadmap]: Minimax engine built with Four in a Row first (simplest branching factor validates engine design)
- [Roadmap]: Chess deferred to Phase 5 (highest-risk external dependency, de-risk by proving value with word/board games first)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Stockfish iOS wrapper availability unverified -- needs validation before Phase 5 planning
- [Research]: GamePigeon Mancala rule variants undocumented -- needs investigation before Phase 4 planning
- [Research]: Dictionary source (NWL2023 vs SOWPODS) availability and licensing unverified
